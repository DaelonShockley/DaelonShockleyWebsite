            <h1>CypherStore: Password Generation and Storage App</h1>
            <p>CypherStore is a simple and secure password management application which allows users to generate secure passwords, as well as store and encrypt their login
                information locally. This application features AES encryption to allow secure storage of login information on device. Passwords are generated using a secure 
                RNG algorithm, ensuring that it's impossible to recreate your passwords. <br><br>
                <b> Goals: </b>Refresh my C# and Visual Studio Skills, Learn about implementing encryption, Create a handy password storage application for personal use. <br>
                <b>Technologies Used: </b> C#.NET, Windows Forms, Visual Studio, AES, CPRNG <br>

            <h1>Professional/Portfolio Website</h1>
            <p>That's right, the website you're reading right now is a project of mine. This website is written entirely in raw HTML and CSS (not counting about 10 lines of javascript for some effects)
                I decided to make this website to practice my newly learning HTML/CSS skills, to present myself in a way that's a bit different from a simple resume, and ultimately because I thought it would
                be fun<br><br>
                <b> Goals: </b>Practice HTML/CSS, Create a self-presentation more interesting than a simple resume. <br>
                <b>Technologies Used: </b> HTML, CSS <br>
