        <section class="huhtamaki shadow">
            <h2>Huhtamaki North America</h2>
            <i>Applications Developer Intern</i> <h2 class = "date">May 2024 - Aug 2024</h2>
            <p>At Huhtamaki I developed a web application for organizing case-level labels printed on Huhtamaki production floors. 
                This application utilizes an SQL database created in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, the data collection 
                for which I was largely able to automate using powershell, saving our team time. My primary focus for this internship 
                was developing an IT facing application built in Sencha Architect using JavaScript that concisely displays all existing 
                labels, along with their associated characteristics. This application allows the user to easily add, delete, or edit any 
                label information as necessary by utilizing a variety of PHP scripts to interface with the database. This project allowed 
                for a significant improvement in the organization and ability to maintain Huhtamakis large set of customer labels. 
            <br>
            As a secondary focus, I assisted Huhtamaki's AI Pilot team in rolling out Microsoft Copilot to nearly 300 Huhtamaki employees 
                across 25 countries. For this, my role primarily involved analyzing user feedback to determine whether the reception of this 
                tool was positive or negative, and to determine which areas users may want additional training in, in order to present recommendations 
                to the team.

            <h2>EaglePicher Technologies</h2>
            <i>Computer Engineering Intern</i> <h2 class="date">May 2023 - Aug 2024</h2>
            <p>
                As an intern at EaglePicher, I applied my hardware and software skills to develop projects which increased the efficiency, accuracy, 
                and convenience of EaglePicher’s test lab. My time at EaglePicher consisted of three primary projects:
            </p>
            <ul class = "EP-list">
                <li>
                    <p>
                        I developed an automated temperature control system for the lab’s temperature chambers using a python program. A programmatic 
                        PID loop was included to quickly account for the difference in the air temperature and battery temperature in the chamber. This 
                        system enabled unattended testing, allowing tests to be run outside of work hours and without technician intervention. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        I created an intuitive and user friendly configuration application for the lab’s data acquisition systems, replacing manual .cfg 
                        file editing by technicians. This reduces the risk of user error, increases the speed of configuration changes, and allows technicians 
                        without specialized system knowledge to make edits. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Added functionality to an existing procedure file viewing application, enabling reading complex procedure files, including those with 
                        cycles and nested calls. Implemented an event time estimation feature. Caught and corrected a preexisting error consuming system hard drive space. 
                    </p>
