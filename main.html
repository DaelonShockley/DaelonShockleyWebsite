            <p class="main">My name is Daelon Shockley, and Iâ€™m an aspiring software developer from Carthage, Missouri. 
                In December of 2024, I graduated magna cum laude with a B.S. in Computer Engineering from the 
                Missouri University of Science and Technology in Rolla, Missouri. During my time at Missouri S&T I 
                completed two internships at EaglePicher Technologies and Huhtamaki where I put my problem solving skills
                 to the test, solving problems facing the company with an evolving set of software and hardware knowledge. 
                 Additionally, during my time in college I worked on a number of projects, was a part of multiple clubs, 
                 and even had a little fun (shocking, I know), which you can learn more about on the other pages of this website. 
                 Iâ€™m always looking to face new challenges and learn new skills (which this website is the result of), and Iâ€™m 
                 currently looking for a position within a company where I can do exactly that.  </p>
